Enhanced VESC Functionality for Xiaomi and Ninebot Scooters via Lisp Scripting
This repository provides Lisp scripts to extend the capabilities of VESC motor controllers when used with Xiaomi and Ninebot electric scooters. These scripts enable advanced customization and integration features beyond the standard VESC firmware.

<h2 align="center" >DASHBOARD INTEGRATION</h2> 

Achieve seamless communication between the VESC and the original Xiaomi/Ninebot dashboard. This allows for the display of crucial information such as speed, battery level, riding mode, and support with the Scooter Hacking Utility App!

<h2 align="center" >CUSTOMIZABLE FEATURES</h2>

- Eco modes for extended range.
- Speed limiters for safety.
- Custom riding modes with different performance characteristics.
- Diagnostics and error reporting.
